Much like with everything Google these days I'm looking for replacements for tools I used to use and trust by them. I used to use Google Analytics for tracking everything. It was always way more than I needed, but I could get what I needed and it was free and I used to enjoy the Google ecosystem. Times they have a changed. I no longer enjoy the Google ecosystem, and their analytics platform has simply left me behind. I consider myself a relatively proficient netizen and programmer, but I feel like I can no longer find anything other than the dashboard in GA4. I upgraded professional sites as I really didn't have a choice, but now that I have a little time and new sites like this one I'm looking for some replacement technologies.

Looking at [Matomo](https://matomo.org/matomo-on-premise/) and [Umami](https://umami.is/) today. They both look nice, and allow self-hosting. Matomo looks like it offers more of the features I remember from back when I used to be able to navigate GA, but as I stated I never really needed all of that. Umami looks nice, and seems more streamlined to my light usage needs. They both have demo sites you could check out: [Matomo Demo Site](https://demo.matomo.cloud/index.php?module=CoreHome&action=index&idSite=1&period=day&date=yesterday#?period=day&date=yesterday&idSite=1&category=Dashboard_Dashboard&subcategory=1), [Umami Demo Site](https://eu.umami.is/share/LGazGOecbDtaIwDr/umami.is).

Now I just have to keep waiting for my Amazon delivery with my new Pi server and hardware, so I can have somewhere to install things. My plan is to install the Umami db on my new Pi server which I'm going to keep internal on my network. The actual Umami app will get installed on the webserver I think unless I can come up with another idea to keep it externally accessible but not fully exposed... We'll see.
