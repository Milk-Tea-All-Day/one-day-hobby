In true ODH fashion, I'm doing something completely different. I've tried this a handful of times before, usually with basil, but this time I'm working with a wall of shrubs ([Photinia x faseri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photinia_%C3%97_fraseri)) in the back of our house.

A couple of years ago, I think the neighbor poured a bunch of weed killer around them (they're right on the property dividing line), and about seven of them died. I live in a rental, so I'm not too concerned.

The few that are still alive shot up recently with all the spring sunshine and warmth, so I had to trim them. I decided to keep a handful of the clippings and see if I can get them to root and start some replacements.

I used some of our old glass bottles to house them, including some ramune bottles üòÇ.

I've just been filling them with water, and they seem to be doing okay so far. (This is actually my second batch. I kept the first batch outside, but the wind kept blowing them out of the bottles. I eventually gave up and started over, keeping this batch inside my office.)

I also decided to try some extra help to see if i could encourage or speed up the rooting. Had to figure out what to look for in Japan, not that I knew in America either, but it's definitely harder for me in Japanese! I eventually discovered that I could use [„É°„Éç„Éá„Éº„É´ (Menedael)](https://www.menedael.co.jp/) - a liquid vitamin-based rooting aid.
