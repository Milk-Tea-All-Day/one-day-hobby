This is my first test post that I made from scratch. The idea is that I'll use this to post content to a new hobby site and track all the various things I'm interested in. I'm not going to go into all the things I've done up until now, as it's vast and there's no fun there. If I get interested in those things again, then I'll write about them in that moment.

I've got a couple things I'm doing simultaneously right now at the moment. So, multiple one-day hobbies. I guess since that's the whole theme of the site, I think I'll refer to them as an `ODH`. So, yeah, multiple `ODH`s going on right now:

* [I got a new keyboard (Keychron K8 Pro Wireless),](#Keyboard)
* [new Raspberry Pi server](#Raspberry-Pi-Server)
* [and, playing with Hexo to power this new journal](#Hexo-SSG)

# Keyboard

## Old Keyboard
I was using a [Razor BlackWindow V3 Mini HyperSpeed Phantom Pudding Edition](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B09FY5P1LS), with Yellow Switches. I've been using that for about 3 years now (wow! I hadn't realized it was that long until now.) It definitely took a while to get used to, it was my first foray into any reduced size keyboard (outside of a laptop keyboard) at 65%. I had to rewire my brain to use the function key a lot, and get used to the closer keys, etc. Overall, I got pretty used to it, and it became fairly second nature for me.

### Frustrations
However, there were a few things that were always annoying. As a programmer I find my self using the ``` key a lot, and having to hold a function key to access this was pretty annoying, but I did get used it, but it was never fully natural.

I also missed having my function keys readily available (F1, F2, etc). This came into play in work setting occassionaly, with legacy software I have to use, and more often in gaming scenarios. Which is kind of funny given this is a "gaming" keyboard.

I came to terms with another short-coming pretty early on after buying this, as I bought a wireless keyboard, and expected to use it as such. But with the RGB lighting, I found the battery life to be pretty ridiculously low, and I effectively felt I had to charge it daily and it basically just became a wired keyboard. I didn't like this, as I've been working to reduce the wires/clutter on my desk for a while (although have reintroduced some over the last year, le-sigh).

Related to the lighting, it bothers me that I have to install Razer software to manage my keyboard lighting. Feels kind of slimy, and the software is constantly getting updates, and generally just feels a bit 'in the way'. And I was using the keyboard through a USB switch, and the lighting would occasionally just die... I'd have to relaunch the software and then it would turn back on. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The absolute death knell for this keyboard and my relationship though was sensitivity. It's always been a very sensitive keyboard. I'd leave my fingers resting on home row as I look at something, only to realize my slightest of pressure on, say,  the `J` key, was being registered the whole time and I had been spamming that key into my IDE or Notepad, or somewhere. Over the past couple of weeks though, more and more keys have started getting super sensitive, to the point that one single press seems to be registering as 2-3 key presses. This has really slowed down my typing and thought process in the day.

That last issue, plus the other issues lead to me  re-evaluating what a _good_ keyboard for me might be. So, the hunt was on...

## New Keyboard

I honestly didn't do a ton of searching this go-round. I kind of new some of the basic criteria I wanted:

* Wireless
* mechanical switches (still don't really have a strong preference yet)
* Reduced size, but larger than 65%
* White, if possible

Heading over to Amazon Japan, I really didn't have that many options (at least from brands that I at least recognize in some fashion). I quickly came across the Keychron K8 Pro Wireless that seems to hit all my criteria. I read and watched a handful of review, and it seemed like I was going to be relatively happy with this selection, so I went for it. One of the things people talk about with it, is the heft of the keyboard, and they're not wrong. It feels super solid. The keys have a verry nice feel to them, and the sound is kind of perfect for me. I get a bit of that mechanical clickety-clackety, but it's kind of muted a little due to that sound foam in the base I assume.

I also appreciate that it came with a few extra keycaps, to switch between Win/Mac layouts, and some option red keys for accents if you want. And the lighting effects are all housed in the keyboard itself. I can easily adjust them or disable them on here without issue, and haven't installed any software for this keyboard so far, which I like.

This really isn't a ODH, as I'll certainly be using the crap out of a keyboard due to my job and hobbies, but I'll probably only research keyboards for a day or so üòÄ.

# Raspberry Pi Server

# Hexo SSG

I'm trying out Hexo to power this new site. So far it's pretty impressive for just getting something up and running.
