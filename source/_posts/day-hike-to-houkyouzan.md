Changed things up today and went for a hike. It was great to get outside with my youngest (7). We went back to ÂÆùÁØãÂ±± (_Mt. Houkyouzan_), a place we‚Äôve hiked before, but this time we tried some different trails to keep things fresh.

The weather was unpredictable‚Äîcold, warm, cloudy, sunny, dry, raining. We experienced a variety of weather, but that just made it more fun. We kept talking about how it made our 'adventure' more exciting. On the way to the summit, we had lunch. It was in a fairly open area, and it was getting colder then. We brought one of our favorite hiking snacks: Jagariko, that  we made into mashed potatoes!ü§§ It‚Äôs so simple‚Äîjust add hot water to a cup of Jagariko, let it sit for a minute or two, and mash it up‚Äîbut having something warm when it‚Äôs cold outside is always extra satisfying.

The summit also has some interesting features. There‚Äôs a tall radio tower that you can‚Äôt miss, along with a statue of an old man giving a piggyback ride to a child, which my son asked to mimic. I declined, due to the backpack I was wearing (_and I was getting a little tired!_)

The tower can be seen from the rest area parking lot, which makes for a nice realization that 'we went there'!

# If You‚Äôre Planning a Visit

For anyone curious about hiking Mt. Houkyouzan, it‚Äôs located in Tsukuba City, Ibaraki Prefecture, and is part of the Tsukuba mountain range. The mountain stands at 461 meters and offers views of Tsukuba Mountain, the Kanto Plain, and even Mt. Fuji on clear days.

At the base of the mountain, there‚Äôs a convenient rest area with **free parking**, **toilets**, plenty of **picnic tables**, and even a spot to clean off your hiking gear after the trek. It‚Äôs a well-maintained and welcoming spot, which makes it great for family hikes.

If you‚Äôre interested in the trails, the city provides a [PDF map](https://www.city.tsukuba.lg.jp/material/files/group/110/houkyousan_trekking_map2024_8.pdf) (Japanese) showing the available routes. The trails are pretty well-marked and offer a decent variety of experiences.

According to [Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AE%9D%E7%AF%8B%E5%B1%B1), the mountain also has a lot of history. It‚Äôs part of the Suigo-Tsukuba Quasi-National Park and home to the Houkyouintou, a stone pagoda from the Kamakura period that gives the mountain its name. In recent years, the trails have been improved by local volunteers, and now over 100,000 people visit annually.

# Overall

It was a fun day overall, and I‚Äôm hopeful that my son and I will get out for more hikes this year. I always enjoy finding a new random place to go checkout.
